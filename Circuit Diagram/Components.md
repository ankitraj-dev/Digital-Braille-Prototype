## ðŸ”§ Components Used

### Electronics
- **Arduino-compatible microcontroller board**
- **Arduino compatible cable**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper wires** (male-to-male, male-to-female as needed)
- **Push button**
- **10kÎ© resistor** (for pull-down circuit)
- **12V power supply** (minimum 1.2A for 6 solenoids @ 200mA each)  
  - Ensure correct plug size (5.5x2.1mm is common)
- **5.5x2.1mm barrel plug (female) to screw terminal adapter**
- **N-channel MOSFETs (x6)**
- **Mini push-pull 12V solenoids (x6)**
- **Rectifier diodes (1N4001 or similar, x6)**
- **Spring clips (x6)**

### Tools & Accessories
- Additional jumper wires
- Wire strippers

### Computer Requirements
- **Windows or Mac computer** (Chromebook possible with web-based editor)
- **Arduino IDE** (installed version or web-based editor)    
- **USB port**  
  - Arduino uses USB-C â†’ USB-A to C cable included in Science Buddies kit  
  - Adapter or alternative cable may be required if computer has only USB-C ports
